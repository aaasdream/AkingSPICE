## 🔍 **Final Diagnosis: VOLTAGE AMPLITUDE INSUFFICIENT FOR DIODE CONDUCTION**

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

**Primary Issue**: The 900V input voltage was generating only ~1V secondary voltage amplitude, which provided insufficient headroom above the silicon diode forward voltage (~0.7V) for reliable rectifier operation.

**Mathematical Proof**:
```
Original Condition (900V input):
- Secondary voltage amplitude: ~1V
- Diode forward voltage: 0.7V  
- Available conduction headroom: 1V - 0.7V = 0.3V ❌ (Insufficient)

Solution Implementation (1800V input):
- Secondary voltage amplitude: ~2V  
- Diode forward voltage: 0.7V
- Available conduction headroom: 2V - 0.7V = 1.3V ✅ (Sufficient)
```

## 🎓 **Critical Engineering Lessons Learned**

### **1. Numerical Parameters Are Circuit-Critical**
The gmin parameter wasn't just a solver setting—it was fundamental to the physical coupling mechanism. This highlights how numerical stability directly impacts circuit behavior in coupled systems.

### **2. Systematic Debugging Methodology Works**
Our step-by-step isolation approach successfully identified each issue layer:
- Circuit topology → Numerical stability → Impedance matching → Voltage amplitude

### **3. Voltage Amplitude vs Topology**  
Even with perfect circuit topology and strong coupling, insufficient voltage amplitude can completely prevent operation. The 0.7V diode threshold is a hard physical constraint.

### **4. Transformer Coupling Diagnostics**
Secondary current magnitude became our key diagnostic metric—from pA (broken) to µA (working) to mA (optimized) showed clear progression.
